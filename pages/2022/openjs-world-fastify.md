In my journey through nodeland, I went into the woods. After a nice stroll, I started seeing V8 shapes everywhere. They led into a dark cave and there was a new one every time I turned my head. My mind became megamorphic. What's a V8 shape? Why does it matter? Are there any problems if we created many? Could we reduce the overhead by keeping the shapes constants? This is the story of Fastify v4 on how I optimised the throughput by 10% by ensuring that all requests were created with the same shapes.

It's 2030 and all companies are now digital but users are dissatisfied and keep loving a few brands. The best ones offer a seamless digital experience. The worst are sluggish and they wonder how they got there and how to improve. In short, nothing has changed since 2022.

As developers, we are struggling to satisfy all the non-functional requirements.
Our applications need to be easy to develop and even simpler to maintain. They need to be cheap to run and to have the capability to scale. They must be packed with new features. Multiple teams must work on them to deliver new features on a bi-weekly (or more frequent) basis. Unfortunately it is impossible to achieve those goals and tradeoffs are requiredâ€¦ and they result in unusable, unmaintainable or poorly scalable applications.

There is another way. Small teams that develop applications built on the same language that runs on Web, Mobile, in the backend and on the edge. They can complement each other's skills to develop ground-breaking user experiences at a high velocity.
